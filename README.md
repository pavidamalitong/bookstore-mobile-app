# BookJour! â€” Bookstore Mobile App
The BookJour is a user-friendly mobile application designed for seamless book browsing and shopping. It features a signup and login system, ensuring secure access for users. The app comes preloaded with mock data for 200 books, each including detailed information such as title, author, publisher, ISBN, description, rating and price. Users can search for books by title, author, publisher, or ISBN, with search results displaying the remaining stock for each title. A shopping cart system allows users to add books to their cart, view the total price of their selections, and proceed to checkout. While no payment processing is implemented, the app accurately manages stock levels by reducing the inventory when users purchase books.
